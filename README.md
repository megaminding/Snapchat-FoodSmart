## FoodSmart


We built FoodSmart to address food insecurity, with an emphasis on streamlining access to food resources.

FoodSmart is a Snapchat feature prototype that was developed under a cross-collaboration team. 
- Developers: Megan Tieu, Winston Giang
- Marketers: Soleil Cardenas, Sophia Cortez
- Designers: Betty Shin, Hunter Moranville

We pitched our feature to Snap's Executives and received positive feedback.

**"Your team leaned in and used the people as the technology, but you guys were also so smart about using the data that we can collect about people. I can see this thing  becoming self-perpetuating over time and I thought this was very smart. Lovely work."** -Chief Creative Officer Colleen DeCourcy

"**This idea strikes me as something that would get a lot of momentum because thereâ€™s a lot of product market fit aspect."** - Chief Operating Officer Jerry Hunter
